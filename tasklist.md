Project: PostgreSQL AI Agent MVP - Task & Progress Tracker
Version: 1.0
Last Updated: June 23, 2024
Project Status: NOT_STARTED

📌 Overview
This document serves as the master task list and progress tracker for building the PostgreSQL AI Agent MVP, as detailed in the PRD.md. It is designed to be parsed and actioned by AI developer agents, enabling a consistent and resilient development workflow. Each task is an atomic unit of work with clear dependencies, inputs, outputs, and acceptance criteria.

How to Use This Document
Sequential Execution: Tasks should be executed in order, respecting the Dependencies field.

Status Updates: The Status of each task MUST be updated by the agent upon starting, completing, or encountering an error.

PENDING: The task has not been started.

IN_PROGRESS: The task is currently being worked on.

DONE: The task is complete and all acceptance criteria are met.

BLOCKED: The task cannot be started due to an unmet dependency.

ERROR: The agent failed to complete the task. See Agent Log/Notes and the Global Mistake Log.

Agent Logging: Agents must log their actions, decisions, and any issues encountered in the Agent Log/Notes section for each task. This is critical for resuming work.

Mistake Logging: All errors MUST be logged in the Global Mistake & Learning Log at the end of this document. This log should be reviewed by agents before starting new tasks to avoid repeating past mistakes.

PHASE 1: Core Foundation (Week 1-2)
Goal: Establish the basic project structure, API, and the LangGraph orchestration framework for a simple SELECT query workflow.

Update LangGraph Workflow for Destructive Queries

System Workflow

P2.T3, P3.T3

DONE

Successfully implemented P3.T4.1: Modified OrchestratorAgent to route UPDATE/DELETE/INSERT queries to the new destructive query workflow. Created comprehensive LangGraph workflow (destructive_query_flow.py) with 8 nodes: fetch_schema -> build_query -> validate_query -> analyze_impact -> check_approval_required -> create_approval/execute_query. Includes conditional routing based on risk levels (LOW/MEDIUM auto-approved, HIGH/CRITICAL require human approval). Fixed validation logic to properly handle QueryBuilderAgent.validate_query return format. Tested successfully with orchestrator routing working correctly for all destructive query types.

P3.T4.1

UPDATE/DELETE/INSERT Flow

P2.T3.1

DONE

Successfully implemented P3.T4.1: Modified OrchestratorAgent to route UPDATE/DELETE/INSERT queries to the new destructive query workflow. Created comprehensive LangGraph workflow (destructive_query_flow.py) with 8 nodes: fetch_schema -> build_query -> validate_query -> analyze_impact -> check_approval_required -> create_approval/execute_query. Includes conditional routing based on risk levels (LOW/MEDIUM auto-approved, HIGH/CRITICAL require human approval). Fixed validation logic to properly handle QueryBuilderAgent.validate_query return format. Tested successfully with orchestrator routing working correctly for all destructive query types.

P3.T4.2

Add conditional routing to the LangGraph graph. After query building, if the query is destructive, route to analyze_query_impact.

UPDATE/DELETE/INSERT Flow

P3.T1.2, P2.T3.2

DONE

Successfully implemented P3.T4.2: Created unified query workflow (unified_query_flow.py) with conditional routing AFTER query building. The workflow builds SQL first, then determines if it's SELECT or destructive, then routes accordingly. Updated OrchestratorAgent to use unified workflow. Key innovation: Query type determined from generated SQL, not initial intent, allowing for more accurate routing. Tested successfully with examples showing intent changing from UNKNOWN to DESTRUCTIVE after query building.

P3.T4.3

Add a human-in-the-loop step: after creating an approval request, the graph should wait and periodically call check_approval_status until it is APPROVED.

Approval Workflow

P3.T2.2, P3.T4.2

DONE

Successfully implemented P3.T4.3: Enhanced unified workflow with human-in-the-loop approval process. The workflow creates approval requests for high-risk queries, then periodically checks approval status until APPROVED/REJECTED. Features include: check count tracking, timeout protection (5 checks max), rich human-in-the-loop metadata, status transitions, and manual approval URLs. Tested successfully with approval ticket creation, periodic status checking, and proper routing through orchestrator.

P3.T4.4

📝 Global Mistake & Learning Log
Purpose: To track all errors, their root causes, and resolutions. All agents MUST review this log before starting a new task to learn from past mistakes.

Resolution & Preventative Action

M-001

Example

2024-06-23

Agent used a hardcoded database URL instead of the environment variable.

The agent's prompt was not specific enough to enforce the use of environment variables for configuration.

Resolution: Corrected the code to use os.getenv(). 
 Preventative Action: Update agent system prompt to explicitly forbid hardcoded credentials and configuration, and to always load them from environment variables.
