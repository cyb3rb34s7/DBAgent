  - ✅ P1.T5.2: execute_query node implemented
  - ✅ P1.T5.3: Graph flow connected properly
  - ✅ P1.T5.4: Integrated with WebSocket endpoint

### In Progress
*None - Phase 1 Complete*

### Next Phase
- Phase 2: Query Intelligence (Week 3-4) - Will use Gemini API for LLM operations

## 🚨 Mistakes & Learning Log
*This section will track all errors and their resolutions to prevent repetition*

### M-001: [Template - will be filled when issues occur]
- **Task**: 
- **Issue**: 
- **Root Cause**: 
- **Resolution**: 
- **Prevention**: 

## 💬 Conversation Context
- User confirmed MVP scope is appropriate
- Tasklist reviewed and approved
- Working rules established:
  - Strict adherence to tasklist.md
  - Phase-by-phase testing approach
  - Windows PowerShell commands only
  - Maintain context.md for continuity
- P1.T1 completed successfully - ready for P1.T2
- P1.T2 completed successfully - FastAPI server working on port 8001
- P1.T3 completed successfully - OrchestratorAgent integrated and tested
- P1.T4 completed successfully - Database operations with security validation
- P1.T5 completed successfully - LangGraph workflow fully integrated
- 🎉 **PHASE 1 COMPLETE** - All core foundation tasks implemented and tested
- **API CHANGE**: Switched from Groq to Gemini API - GEMINI_API_KEY configured

## 🔧 Technical Environment
- **OS**: Windows 10.0.26100
- **Shell**: PowerShell
- **Workspace**: D:\PROJECTS\DBAGENT
- **Target Stack**: Python, FastAPI, LangGraph, PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Virtual Environment**: ✅ Active (venv)
- **Dependencies**: ✅ Installed (langgraph, fastapi, uvicorn, psycopg2-binary, redis, python-dotenv)
- **AI Provider**: Gemini API (GEMINI_API_KEY in .env)

## 📝 Notes
- User will test each phase before proceeding
- Must update both tasklist.md and context.md after milestones
- Use this file for resumption after interruptions
- Environment variables template created (.env.example) - Updated for Gemini API
- FastAPI server tested and working with health endpoint and WebSocket
- OrchestratorAgent successfully classifies queries and routes them appropriately
- Database operations include comprehensive security validation and error handling
- Server is assumed to be running - don't restart it
- LangGraph workflow provides complete SELECT query processing with proper state management
- **IMPORTANT**: All future LLM operations will use Gemini API instead of Groq
